## Attention

I'm a hobbyist/amateur at best. So there may be things that aren't optimized. For example the routing on the PCB is a hot mess
and the spacers between the plate should be 3.4mm but there aren't any spacers that size. That being said I've had the files
in the `gerbers/` directory manufactured at JLC with 1.6mm size and they work just fine with the code provided in the `qmk/`
directory. So if you decide to use this, then please be advised that I'm not providing any sort of liability and you should
exercise some caution.
